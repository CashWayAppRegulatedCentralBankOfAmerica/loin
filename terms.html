    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Nova Prime, a U.S.-based freelancing marketplace (“we”, “us”, “our”). These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our platform located at https://www.novaprime.com (the “Site”) and any related services we provide. By using Nova Prime, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>

    <h3>4. User Roles</h3>
    <p>Nova Prime supports two primary user roles:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Clients:</strong> Users who post jobs or projects seeking freelance services.</li>
