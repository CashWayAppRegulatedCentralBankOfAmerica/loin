Protecting your rights and privacy related to content is important to us. If you believe your content has been misused, contact our support team. Transparency and respect guide our handling of user content.</p>

<h3>29. Behavioral Advertising</h3>

Users retain control over receiving promotional materials. Our advertising approach reflects our commitment to ethical data use. We believe privacy and business success go hand in hand. If you wish to opt out of any promotional content, it can be managed via account settings. Our policy protects you from unwanted or invasive advertising.</p>
