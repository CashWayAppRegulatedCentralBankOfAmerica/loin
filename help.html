    <p><em>Your questions answered. If you still need help, we're here for you.</em></p>

    <h2>1. Getting Started with Nova Prime</h2>

    <h3>How do I create a Nova Prime account?</h3>
    <p>Click the “Sign Up” button on the homepage and fill in your full name, email address, mobile number, and password. You'll be prompted to verify your email and complete your profile to begin.</p>

    <h3>Is Nova Prime free to use?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Creating an account is completely free. Freelancers pay a small service fee when earning, and clients only pay when hiring.</p>

    <h2>2. Freelancers</h2>

    <h3>How do I find work?</h3>
    <p>Complete your profile, go to "Find Work" and submit bids. Nova Prime will notify you on task details after selection.</p>

    <h3>How do I get paid?</h3>
    <p>After task completion, once payment is released by the client, a verification code is sent to your email. Use this under "My Projects" > "Verify" to mark as Paid. Funds reflect immediately in your account. Withdrawal options include PayPal, bank, etc.</p>

    <h3>Why is my payment Unpaid?</h3>
    <p>Payments may take 24–48 hours after task submission. If marked "Unpaid" beyond 48 hours, an email will explain whether due to rejections or client delays.</p>

    <h2>3. Clients</h2>

    <h3>How do I hire a freelancer?</h3>
    <p>Send a job to <strong>client@1234</strong>. We’ll list it on the platform. You’ll receive bids via email. Reply with “Hire” to start work. Payment is charged only after task completion.</p>

    <h3>Can I cancel a job?</h3>
    <p>Yes, anytime before work begins. Funded milestones will be refunded to your method of payment.</p>

    <h2>4. Security & Disputes</h2>

    <h3>Is Nova Prime safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We use bank-level encryption and two-step verification. Activity is monitored to prevent fraud.</p>

    <h3>What if there's a dispute?</h3>
    <p>Try contacting the other party. If unresolved, open a formal dispute from your dashboard for team intervention.</p>

    <h2>5. Technical Questions</h2>
